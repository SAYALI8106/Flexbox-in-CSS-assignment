//Q2. Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model

1. justify-content

2. align-items

3. gap

4. flex-direction

5. flex-wrap

->
In the Flexbox layout model, each of these properties plays a crucial role in defining the behavior and alignment of flex items within a flex container:

### 1. `justify-content`
**Role:** 
- Aligns the flex items along the main axis (horizontal in a row, vertical in a column).
- Distributes extra space around the items.

**Values:**
- `flex-start`: Items are packed toward the start of the main axis.
- `flex-end`: Items are packed toward the end of the main axis.
- `center`: Items are centered along the main axis.
- `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed; first item is at the start, last item is at the end.
- `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
- `space-evenly`: Items are distributed with equal space between them.

### 2. `align-items`
**Role:**
- Aligns flex items along the cross axis (vertical in a row, horizontal in a column).
- Ensures that all flex items have the same height (or width, in the case of a column) or are aligned according to a specified value.

**Values:**
- `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the start of the cross axis.
- `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: Items are centered along the cross axis.
- `baseline`: Items are aligned such that their baselines align.
- `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the container (default).

### 3. `gap`
**Role:**
- Defines the space between flex items.
- Helps to create spacing without using margins on individual flex items.

**Values:**
- Can be specified in any CSS unit (px, em, %, etc.).
- Example: `gap: 10px;`

### 4. `flex-direction`
**Role:**
- Establishes the main axis, determining the direction in which the flex items are placed in the flex container.

**Values:**
- `row`: Default value; items are placed in a horizontal row.
- `row-reverse`: Items are placed in a horizontal row but in reverse order.
- `column`: Items are placed in a vertical column.
- `column-reverse`: Items are placed in a vertical column but in reverse order.

### 5. `flex-wrap`
**Role:**
- Controls whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.

**Values:**
- `nowrap`: Default value; all flex items are on one line.
- `wrap`: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from top to bottom (or left to right in vertical writing modes).
- `wrap-reverse`: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top (or right to left in vertical writing modes).

These properties give you control over how flex items are aligned, spaced, and arranged within a flex container, enabling you to create flexible and responsive layouts easily.
